| U=250   |  3500       |
| U=95    |  950       |

    Explanation 1: 
        Charge for the first 100 units – 10*100 = 1000 
        Charge for the 100 to 200 units – 15*100 = 1500 
        Charge for the 200 to 250 units – 20*50 = 1000 
        Total Electricity Bill = 1000 + 1500 + 1000 = 3500
    Explanation 2: 
        Charge for the first 100 units – 10*95 = 950
